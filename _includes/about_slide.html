          UNIHACK is a hackathon run for university students, by university students in Melbourne, Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Teams have 24 hours to design and build something awesome. It can be anything - a website, a mobile
          application, a video game, or even something hardware. The important thing is that it needs to work when it is
          presented to the judges.
        </p>
        <p>
          UNIHACK was created by Terence Huynh and Matthew Rossi. It is being organised with the help of WIRED Monash,
          the IT student society at Monash University Clayton.
